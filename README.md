3. Project Goal

To classify MRI images into *tumor* or *non‑tumor* categories using deep learning.

4. Features

* Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
* CNN-based model for tumor classification
* Training and validation pipeline
* Visualization of accuracy/loss
* Prediction script for new MRI images

5. Dataset

Download any brain tumor MRI dataset such as:

* Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset

Place the dataset inside the `dataset/` folder.

6. How to Run

 1. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 2. Preprocess the Dataset

```
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

3. Train the Model

```
python src/train_model.py
```
 4. Evaluate the Model

```
python src/evaluate_model.py
```

5. Predict

```
python src/predict.py --image sample.jpg
```

7.  Model Results (Example Images)

Below are sample output images that show prediction results and model performance visuals.

**Example: Accuracy/Loss Curve**

(Replace this with your training curve screenshot)

```
[Insert accuracy/loss curve image here]
```

**Example: Model Prediction Result**

```
[Insert example prediction MRI image with label]
```

8. Notes

* You can replace the CNN with a more advanced architecture like ResNet or EfficientNet.
* Ensure all images are preprocessed to the same resolution.
